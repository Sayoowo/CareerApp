## Work Distribution

### Principles
- Work distributed **fairly** based on skills and capacity
- Each member contributes roughly equal effort
- Tasks self-assigned from "Ready" column on Kanban board
- Raise concerns about workload balance in weekly meeting

### If Workload Feels Unbalanced
1. Raise in team meeting
2. Discuss redistribution
3. Adjust assignments or deadlines

## Git Workflow

## Fork
- `fork` to your own repository

### Branches
- `main` branch is always stable
- Feature branches: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Create from latest `main`

### Pull Requests
**Before creating:**
- Code compiles (`ant build`)
- Tests pass (`ant test`)
- Follows conventions

**Requirements:**
- At least 1 approval before merge
- Descriptive title and description
- Link related issue: "Closes #XX"

**Code review:**
- Be constructive and specific
- Focus on logic and clarity
- Approve if no major issues

---

## Decision-Making

**Minor** (variable names, small refactors):
- Individual decides

**Moderate** (library choice, implementation approach):
- Propose in GitHub issue or Discord
- Give 24 hours for feedback
- Proceed if no objections

**Major** (architecture changes, scope):
- Discuss in team meeting
- Aim for consensus, vote if needed
- Document decision and reasoning

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Process
1. **Talk directly** with person involved
2. **Team discussion** if unresolved
3. **Get help** from instructor if still stuck

### Common Situations

**Technical disagreements**: Present options, discuss, decide as team, move forward united

**Missed deadlines**: Understand why, adjust timeline or redistribute work

**Unequal contribution**: Raise respectfully, discuss rebalancing, monitor

---

## Code Standards

- Follow stakeholder's code conventions
- Meaningful variable/method names
- Comments for complex logic
- Write regression tests for all code (required)
- Tests must pass before merging
- Clear, descriptive commit messages

---

## Accountability

### Everyone Is Responsible For
- Attending meetings (or notifying in advance)
- Responding within agreed timeframes
- Completing assigned tasks
- Reviewing PRs promptly
- Writing tests
- Updating documentation

### If Commitments Aren't Met
- **First time**: Understand what happened, adjust
